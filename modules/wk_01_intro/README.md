# Week 1: Course Introduction and File Organization

Instructors: Carol Wilusz and Eliud Rivas Hernandez

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this class, you should be able to:

- Understand how your computer organizes files and folders, including parent, child, and root directories.
- Navigate directory structures confidently to find, open, and manage files needed for computational analyses.
- Explain what a file path is and why it matters when working with data, scripts, and software.
- Construct and interpret absolute and relative file paths on both macOS and Windows systems.
- Identify common data and executable file types used in computational biology (e.g., .txt, .csv, .fasta, .py, .R).
- Locate and copy full file paths using your operating system’s file explorer in a program-compatible format.
- Apply basic file-organization best practices that reduce errors and support reproducible research.
- Troubleshoot common file- and path-related errors using error messages and online resources.


## Why this matters:
Nearly all computational tools—command-line programs, R, Python, workflows on HPC systems—assume you understand how files are organized and referenced. These concepts are foundational for everything else we will do in this course.
